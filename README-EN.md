Hey there, my name is Fangxu Niu, and I'm a programmer with almost 6 years of experience. I'm super stoked to introduce myself to you today!

My first job after graduating from university was as a web developer for an English information website and accompanying app, where I was responsible for maintaining the backend development using PHP and MySQL. After that, I worked for a panoramic video and image online exhibition platform, where I maintained the server and system's simple architecture using PHP, MySQL, and Linux.

For the past four and a half years, I worked for a company where I started by cleaning up crawler data and providing interfaces to clients using PHP. Later, I joined the advertising team and developed the backend management system using PHP's Laravel framework. In early 2020, the company switched to using Golang as the main language, and I took the initiative to self-study Golang and contributed to the development of the mid-stage common function module.

In September 2021, the company established a subsidiary in Chengdu, where I applied for a transfer and became the technical lead of the backend team responsible for task allocation and the development of common function modules.

Through these experiences, I have learned how to write industrialized code using PHP, as well as participate in open source projects on Github, where I have submitted code for multiple projects.

I believe that programming languages are similar in terms of thinking, regardless of the language, which has enabled me to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and learn new skills. I'm confident that my diverse experience in PHP and Golang, along with my commitment to delivering quality work and continuous learning, makes me a valuable addition to any team.

Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.
